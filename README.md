iCalOlin
========
---------

A Flask web application for faster, automated iCal calendar integration at Olin College of Engineering.
The application uses mechanize to scrape student schedule information from Olin portal, formats and 
creates iCal objects, and then finally sends iCal attachments to student's preferred email address.
The student can then easily import these iCal objects to their own personal calendar, allowing them to
stay on top of class schedules.
